# TrackMapper
schweizmobil.ch is a service to discover and plan (mostly) hiking/biking tracks in Switzerland. Viewing tracks does not require a paid subscription, drawing own tracks does. The schweizmobil.ch UI is great but unfortunately can only show one of the user-created tracks at a time. I have 300+ tracks and struggle to keep the overview of what I planned/did in a given region.

So, this project ..
* uses the schweizmobil.ch API described at https://github.com/JoeggiCH/schweizmobil.ch-API to download all tracks of a given user (with a paid subscription)
* allows users to filter tracks based on a number of criteria, such as the hike/bike length in kilometers, duration, meters uphill etc
* converts tracks into WGS84 coordinates and a GeoJSON FeatureCollection
* renders the FeatureCollection in a browser-viewable map (using python folium and leaflet.js)

I developed and tested this code (a little) under Windows. 
I also did an installation under a local Ubuntu and the code started but at least one button did not work as expected. Also, I had to install tkinter separately as a binary and pySimpleGUI required an extra step to register in order to get a named user license.

To start, please invoke ```python TrackMapper.pyw```
- The button "Set Filter" brings up a window with filter criteria, which the code will apply to fetch data from schweizmobil.ch
- The button "Fetch Data & Apply Filter" will connect to schweizmobil.ch, obtain the tracks - based on the filtering criteria - and convert them into an html file containing GeoJSON representations of the tracks
- The button 'Open' will open the local map.html file in the default browser
- 'Publish' executes an external script 'update web.bat', which pushes map.html to your own public facing website - once you have modified 'update web.bat' to do so!
- 'Open' will open the public facing website in the default browser


And..
- TrackMapper.py will ask for your schweizmobil.ch credentials and will store them locally in an encrypted file
- You can choose a password for that encrypted file. By default there is no password.
- Once the password file is available, at the next startup TrackMapper.pyw will ask for the password to decrypt the password file. Just hitting 'return' without will work for the empty, default password.
- TrackMapper.py creates a local cache of the tracks, which speeds up fetching tracks from the second time on.

Please note that I am not affiliated in any way with the schweizmobil.ch foundation and this repo is not an official publication of schweizmobil.ch. I created this repo for my training and because I was unable to find another solution for my need.
